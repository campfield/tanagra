% Note in the title= there are two levels of curly braces: {{}}.
%  in this case, without the inner set of braces the title
%  of the entry, once rendered in our final document, would have the
%  capitalization changed to "The book of the subgenius: The sacred teachings of j.r. ’bob’ dobbs."
% Individidual capitalization of specific words can be preserved by encasing them in their own set
%  of curly braces.  as to preserve the capitalization of the name we can use
%  {J.R. 'Bob' Dobbs}, {J.R.} {'Bob' Dobbs}.
